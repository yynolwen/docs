        <p>Although we are working hard on this library, it still has some known shortcomings.
            Consider this list to make sure there are no potential blockings.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>You are using a beta version</strong>
                <p>
                    It's not really named "beta" but you should consider it as such.
                    Once we are sure it's stable and bullet-proof we will increment the major version number.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Formula support is based on a third-party library</strong>
                <p>
                    We use <a href="https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/" target="_blank">formula.js</a> to
                    implement functions. That library is no longer under active development,
                    but we believe it's reliable enough to be utilized even in its current state.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It is not mobile-friendly (yet)</strong>
                <p>
                    Only the basic functionality works with mobile devices, which means you should be able to display,
                    edit and scroll the grid. We can't guarantee that all the plugins will work as we don't test
                    Handsontable in mobile browsers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It uses several dependencies</strong>
                <p>
                    Our team follows the "proudly found elsewhere" principle which encourages us to make
                    use of the great work done by other developers. You will probably find the following
                    open source libraries being utilized by Handsontable:
